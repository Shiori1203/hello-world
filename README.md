Hello, my name is Shiori Nakajima, a freelance translator/writer from Japan.

I decided to learn coding by myself, but I need something that makes me accountable everyday.
So on this Github site, I will manage my learning process and also show you my progress on that.

I am going to learn basic languages HTML/CSS and work on my portofolio. 

Let's see how it will go...



Day 1: 11/22/2017

Today's Progress:
Set up Github account and play around with web interface.
Set up 100 Days of Code Repo.
Install GitHub Desktop and learn to Commit/Upload.


Day 2: 11/23/2017
Today's Progress:
Started building my website from scratch using https://youtu.be/3JluqTojuME and https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp. 
Understood some basic functions to buid it(How to make letters bold/italic, basic structure of html, how to create a link)
Language(s): HTML, CSS

Thoughts: Coding is not as "scary" as I thought it would be. Once I get to know the basic structure, 
I could started adding other additional functions more. Might need some help to move on 
as sometimes my code does not work as I expected. Would use free code camp comunnity to solve problems/questions.
