Day 2: 11/23/2017
Today's Progress:
Started building my website from scratch using https://youtu.be/3JluqTojuME and https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp. 
Understood some basic functions to buid it(How to make letters bold/italic, basic structure of html, how to create a link)
Language(s): HTML, CSS

Thoughts: Coding is not as "scary" as I thought it would be. Once I get to know the basic structure, 
I could started adding other additional functions more. Might need some help to move on 
as sometimes my code does not work as I expected. Would use free code camp comunnity to solve problems/questions.
